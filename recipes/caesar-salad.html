    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>We love this Caesar potato salad recipe on a summer's day, but it works at any time of year.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>8 slices bacon</li>  
      <li>24 baby red potatoes</li>  
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>  
      <li>cracked black pepper to taste</li>  
      <li>â…“ cup Caesar salad dressing</li>  
      <li>4 green onions, diced</li>  
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, occasionally turning, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and crumble.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly tender, about 8 minutes. Drain and transfer potatoes to a baking dish. Drizzle olive oil over potatoes and season with black pepper.</li>
